## Unit 4 Homework Assignment: A Whale Off the Port(folio)
#### In this assignment we were able to analyze different portfolios and compare them against each other using the pandas library in python.
#### My custom portfolio included AMZN, GME and TSLA. 
#### This assignment was challenging, but very fun to dig into! I'm excited to learn from this and apply what I've learned to future assignments.
